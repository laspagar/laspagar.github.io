Purpose
-------
Concise onboarding for AI coding agents working on this Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site. Focus: where content and assets live, safe edit patterns, automation scripts, and project-specific conventions to make low-risk changes.

Quick architecture
------------------
- Content: `_posts/` (blog posts) and `_products/` (products collection). Product pages are generated from `_products/*` and exposed as `site.products` (see `collections:` in `_config.yml`).
- Presentation: `_layouts/` (templates) and `_includes/` (partials: `head.html`, `navlinks.html`, `sharelinks.html`).
- Assets: `assets/products/` for product images, `css/override.css` for styling overrides, and `js/highlightjs/` for syntax highlighting.

Developer workflows
-------------------
- Local preview/build (Ruby + Bundler):
  - bundle install
  - bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload  (or `bundle exec jekyll build` for one-off build)
- Bot-assisted content creation (Node):
  - cd bot-posting && npm install
  - npm run post:article  => creates `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
  - npm run post:product  => creates `_products/slug.md` (front matter: title, price, category, image, keywords)
- Image tooling (Python):
  - scripts/scrape_bintang_images.py -> updates `_data/product_images.yml`
  - scripts/fetch_images_bulk.py -> downloads images to `assets/products/`
  - Dependencies: pip install requests pyyaml beautifulsoup4

Project conventions (important, concrete)
-----------------------------------------
- Post filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`; preserve YAML front matter and `layout: post`.
- Product front matter: include `title`, `price`, `category`, `image` (use `/assets/products/name.jpg`), and `keywords`.
- Collections configured in `_config.yml`:
  collections:
    products:
      output: true
      permalink: /products/:name/
- Use `_includes/navlinks.html` and `_includes/sharelinks.html` for repeated UI; prefer editing includes over copying markup across pages.
- For CSS, edit `css/override.css` (avoid changing vendor files in `js/highlightjs/`).

Automation & data
-----------------
- `_data/product_images.yml` maps product slugs to remote image URLs; the Python scrapers update it.
- After updating `_data/`, run `python3 scripts/fetch_images_bulk.py` to download images and verify `image:` front matter paths.
- Bot-posting generates front matter automatically (see `bot-posting/README.md` for templates and CLI flow).

Safety & review checklist
-------------------------
- Preserve YAML front matter and filename conventions when adding/editing content.
- Run `bundle exec jekyll build` and spot-check affected pages in `_site/` before opening a PR.
- Keep commits focused (one logical change per PR) and include which pages you previewed locally.
- If adding Jekyll plugins, confirm compatibility with GitHub Pages or vendor the plugin and document the change.

Where to look when things break
-------------------------------
- Layout issues: `_layouts/default.html`, `_layouts/post.html`, `_layouts/product.html`.
- Missing images: check `assets/products/` and `_data/product_images.yml`.
- Bot problems: `bot-posting/bin/*` (reproduce with `npm run post:article`).
- Scraper issues: `scripts/scrape_bintang_images.py` and `scripts/fetch_images_bulk.py` (source site structure may change).

Feedback / gaps
----------------
- No `Gemfile` or CI config was discovered; add them if reproducible Ruby versions or automated builds are required.
- If you'd like, I can replace the original `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with this version and tidy wording further — say the word and I'll commit the change.
